## Music Player Challenge ##

Clone this repo and build a music player as shown in the wireframe attached. It doesn't have to play music, but the UI has to behave as if it did. You have the "now playing section" on the left and the master library on the right. You should be able to play/pause/skip tracks etc and other features music players may have that you can think of.

Some notes:

* Don't be tied to the wireframe for design, feel free to change. Design is not the most important criteria but pretty things don't hurt :)

* You can use whatever tools/libraries/assets that you like.

* **Bonus points if you load the music via ajax and play it with HTML5 audio api. A basic http server is provided and can be accessed by the command 'node index.js', along with some creative commons music files (but feel free to add/remove tracks)**

Plan to spend no more than 5-6 hours on this.
